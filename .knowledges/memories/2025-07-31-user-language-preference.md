# Memory: User Language Preference

## Date
2025-07-31

## Context
User has explicitly requested that I remember their language preference and respond in Vietnamese for all future interactions.

## Details
The user's preferred language for communication is Vietnamese (Tiếng Việt). This preference was communicated during a session where we were working on AgentKnowledgeMCP smart prompting features and template refactoring.

## Impact
This affects all future interactions with this user - I should respond in Vietnamese unless specifically asked to use English or another language. This preference should be considered for:
- All conversational responses
- Documentation creation
- Explanations and guidance
- Error messages and feedback
- Code comments when relevant

## Key Takeaways
- User prefers Vietnamese language communication
- This should be consistently applied across all interactions
- Language preference is an important user experience factor
- Memory capture enables personalized service
